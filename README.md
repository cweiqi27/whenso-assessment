## Running the project:
1. Simply run `npm run dev`, `yarn dev` or `pnpm dev` to run the project in your browser, you can also build it first with `build`. By default the port will be at `localhost:5173`.
2. To run the test suites enter `yarn test`.
3. To check lint run `yarn lint`.
4. To format the code run `yarn format`.
